This is a rugged cross country hike. Shiloh battlefield has much thick
undergrowth present today--just as it did before the great battle occurred
there. Snakes are also present during warm weather so be prepared for such. This
trail is especially recommended during fall and winter seasons when undergrowth
and leaves are not as thick, visibility better, and cross-country hiking much
easier. However this compass trail can be hiked any time during the year you
care to tackle it.

A good compass including knowledge of how to use it is a <b><u>must</u></b>.
A liquid-filled compass is highly recommended, as it will increase your speed in
taking accurate bearings. ALL DEGREE READINGS GIVEN IN INSTRUCTIONS ARE MAGNETIC
READINGS--therefore no correction is required for Magnetic Declination. Set
compass to the reading given as accurately as possible for each azimuth.
Distances given in instructions are approximately only. The length of each
compass leg was scaled from a (to the nearest 50 ft) so is &quot;flat land&quot;
distance and no allowance was made for hills and ravines. You should know how to
offset your course around obstacles. CONSULT YOUR MAP FREQUENTLY TO CHECK YOUR
LOCATION AND ROUTE. If you should get lost either try to return to your last
point or go to the nearest road or determine your location. If you should
encounter high water anywhere along the trail consult your map and take a route
on roads to get you around the water and to the next plaque or monument sought.

Start early--this trail takes time. Go by buddies or groups and not alone.
Wear long pants and boots (or good leather shoes). In summer carry a snake bites
kit. Take a canteen and pencil--both needed. Each group should be equipped with
a first aid kit.

NOTE--Due to the tremendous popularity of the Shiloh Military Trail original
Compass Hike a path became worn between many checkpoints. This revised route
takes compass hikers over new terrain not formerly covered. In the future these
two routes for compass hikers will be periodically alternated.
