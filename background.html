<h2>About Shiloh Military Trails</h2>
</center>
<p>Shiloh Military Park is the site of one of
      the largest and most strategic battles during the Civil War.&nbsp; It is
      located 100 miles east of Memphis Tennessee on the banks of the Tennessee
      River about halfway between highways 64 and 57 off Hwy. 22.

 <p>The purpose of the Shiloh Military Trails Inc.&nbsp; is to engender interest in the
      history and beauty of this National Military Park by providing multiple
      hiking venues in and near the park which are designed to educate and
      entertain while at the same time providing vigorous and healthy outdoor
      activity.

  <p>The Shiloh Military Trails were set up in June, 1960 by Ken
      Humphreys, a Boy Scout leader in Memphis and the Shiloh National
      Park Superintendent. There are eleven different hikes (9 trails and
      2 treks) ranging in
      length from 2 to 20 miles. The trails are managed by a nonprofit
      corporation, Shiloh Military Trails, Inc. and are staffed by volunteers
      drawn mostly from scouting and hiking organizations.</font></font></td>

   <p>You are requested to call, fax, or write and order (at no charge) a
      Unit Application at least three weeks before you plan a hike. You
      can also select <a href="unitap.htm">UNIT APPLICATION</a> and print one from the
      NET. Then you can choose a hike and order hike maps,
      instructions and credential cards for each hiker (at a small
      charge). After completing the hike you may send back each hiker's
      credential card (with all questions answered) and order them patches, hat
      pins and metals for that particular hike (at a small charge).

   <p>After someone has completed six different hikes and other requirements
      they qualify to be designated as a &quot;Shiloh
      Veteran Hiker&quot; and receive a
      special patch, pin and a 12 x 16 certificate. Call us at
      901 351-0174, or write us at P O Box 17057 Memphis, TN
      38187-0507. Or better yet select email us at <a href="mailto:shilohmilitarytrails@gmail.com">shilohmilitarytrails@gmail.com</a>
      . Happy Trails!
