        hike through some of the most interesting area of Shiloh National
        Military Park.&nbsp; This short, easy, and informative hike is designed especially
        for Cub Scouts, Junior Girl Scouts, and other young hikers not old enough
        to be eligible for the much longer Shiloh Military Trails (which is 14
        miles longer and is for hikers at least 11 years old).&nbsp; The Shiloh
        Battlefield Trek is designed to introduce young hikers, their parents,
        and group leaders to the historic battlefield of Shiloh and show them
        where some of the most fierce fighting occurred.&nbsp; Included on the
        route are such famous Shiloh landmarks as the Hornets Nest, Sunken road,
        War Cabin, Peach Orchard and Ruggles' Batteries.</td>
