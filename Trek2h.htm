      thing about the Indian boys and girls though, they were very obedient
      children. They knew what was right and what was wrong, and they had great
      respect for their parents and the elders in the tribe. In the Chickasaw
      tribe children were related to their Mother's family or clan, not their
      Father's, but women had authority only over the girls. A disobedient son
      was sent to the eldest uncle of the Mother's clan. For punishment, the
      uncle might just scold the offender, make him do a small amount of
      distasteful work, or appeal to the boy's feelings of honor or shame. If
      all of these things did not work, the boy might be required to sit still
      while the uncle poured ice cold water over his head and all over his body.
      In the case where the elders believed that a boy was not acting according
      to the customs of the tribe or note behaving like a future warrior he
      would be lashed with a whip of woven grass. The worst thing an Indian boy
      or girl could do was steal. Honest and truthfulness were the main laws of
      the tribe. If one became a thief and stole from his friends or neighbors
      he could be sure that the punishment would be severe. The Chickasaw's
      custom was to punish thievery by scratching the back of the guilty person
      with the dried teeth of a snake. (PAUSE!)</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

      most common and useful natural foods the Chickasaw's used were the deer

      the Indian brave liked this best because it was thought that by eating
      deer meat he too would be able to run fast and be graceful like the deer.
      The deer's flesh was eaten fresh or dried and was smoked for use in the
      winter. Deer shin was the principle material used for clothing. Antler
      tips were used as arrow points, and the dried sinew and entrails were
      twisted and used for bow strings and thread for sewing and weaving
      fishnets. Indian women used deer brains for softening and tanning skins.
      The tough bear hide was made into strong moccasins and hunting boots, and
      dried bear gut was a favorite with the warriors as bowstring material. An
      important item derived from the bear was oil. Slabs of fat taken from the
      bear carcass were cooked over fires to obtain the oil which was clear and
      good tasting especially when the usual amount of sassafras and wild
      cinnamon was added. This oil was used for cooking, for hair groom, and as
      a body rub for many common body aches and pains.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

      the hunting. Nearly every part of the deer and bear obtained by the
      successful hunting party was used in some way. Next to the hunting the
      Indian brave was a warrior and his fighting skill was very important to
      the survival of the tribe. He was required to obtain and protect lands
      that were well stocked with game so that the hunt could be rewarding. For
      this reason we can see how important it was for Indian boys to learn the
      skills of a brave hunter and warrior. Boys between the ages of twelve and
      fifteen were assigned to men in the village, the elders, who instructed
      them in the necessary knowledge that would enable them to be successful
      when their time came to support the tribe. They practiced long hours in
      the skills of swimming, jumping, running, wrestling, and the use of
      weapons. Upon being initiated as a warrior, the young men were required to
      jump into a cold stream in the coldest part of winter and eat special

      way of living that enabled these Indians to stay ;in one place long enough
      to build the large mounds that were the central feature of their village.
      Along with hunting and fishing these Indian people were keen farmers.
      Besides tobacco, pumpkins, and beans, they grew corn, which is the most
      important food item that the white man obtained from the red man. This way
      of life enabled them to settle in one place long enough an din large
      enough numbers to create a large village and to develop the religious and
      ceremonial complex of mounds which we can see the remains of even today.
