<font SIZE="2"><u>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
</u>
<p>The Shiloh Artillery Hike is an unusual and very interesting hike designed to
introduce hikers to Civil War cannons and tell them something about the part
that artillery batteries played in the Battle of Shiloh. The hiker will observe
many of the guns now located on Shiloh Battlefield. The Shiloh Artillery Hike <i>(SMT</i>
<i>Hike No. 2)</i> is recommended especially for those who have already hiked
the first time Shiloh Military Trail Hike No.1. <i>(However this SMT No. 1 Hike
is not a prerequisite for SMT Hike No. 2)</i>. The Shiloh Artillery Hike is a 14
mile long loop trail which begins and ends near the southwest corner of Shiloh
National Military Park (by Ed Shaw's Restaurant located at the intersection of
TN Highways No. 22 and No. 142).</p>
<u>
<p>AWARDS</p>
</u>
<p>For those hikers who complete all requirements to earn them (by hiking the
specified Artillery Trail, completing the required reading, seeing the movie and
visiting the museum) a special fully embroidered colorful patch is available as
well as a small cannon shaped pin <i>(to attach to the ribbon of the No. 1 Hike</i>
<i>Medal)</i>. The hike leader should place one order for all of his Artillery
Trail hikers and send in completed (and checked) credential cards, proper
remittance, and the order <i>blank (Part C of the SMT unit application</i> <i>which
gives the prices for awards).</i> The purchase of any and all SMT awards is
entirely optional.</p>
<u>
<p>HISTORY</p>
</u>
<p>There are now over 200 cannons located on the Shiloh Battlefield today. These
represent more than 10 different kinds and types of Civil War cannons. These
types can be recognized by the size and shape of the barrels. Some have smooth
bores (barrel without grooves inside) while others have rifled bores (barrel has
grooves inside). Many of these guns were made with smooth bores originally and
the rifling added at a later date. Some of their guns were made in the South and
used by Confederate batteries. Sometime these Confederate made guns can be
identified by the foundry name and location. All of these CSA guns are now
located in Ruggles Batteries. Almost all the guns at Shiloh are &quot;field
pieces.&quot; A few seige guns may be observed in the National Cemetery. During
the Battle of Shiloh only &quot;field pieces&quot; were used. The only exception
were the guns aboard the union gunboats, Tyler and Lexington, and some 24 PDR
seige guns which formed the center of Grant's Last Line at Pittsburg Landing.</p>
<u>
