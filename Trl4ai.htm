      battlefield has much thick undergrowth present today--just as it did
      before the great battle occurred there. Snakes are also present during
      warm weather so be prepared for such. This trail is especially recommended
      during fall and winter seasons when undergrowth and leaves are not as
      thick, visibility better, and cross-country hiking much easier. However

      use it is a <u>must</u>. A liquid-filled compass is highly recommended, as
      it will increase your speed in taking accurate bearings. ALL DEGREE
      READINGS GIVEN IN INSTRUCTIONS ARE MAGNETIC READINGS--THEREFORE NO
      CORRECTION IS REQUIRED FOR MAGNETIC READINGS--therefore no correction is
      required for Magnetic Declination. Set compass to the reading given as an
      accurately as possible for each azimuth. Distances given in instructions
      are approximately only. The length of each compass leg was scaled from a
      map (to the nearest 50 ft.) so Is &quot;flat land&quot; distance and no
      allowance was made for hills and ravines. You should know how to offset
      your course around obstacles. CONSULT YOUR MAP FREQUENTLY TO CHECK YOUR
      LOCATION AND ROUTE. If you should get lost either try to return to your
      last point or go to the nearest road and determine your location. If you
      should encounter high water anywhere along the trail consult your map and
      take a route on roads to get you around the water and to the next plaque
      or monument sought.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
