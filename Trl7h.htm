<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we think of Shiloh, our minds quickly picture waves of soldiers charging across open fields, of the thunderous roar of cannon, and the unbelievable hardships of war. It’s true that these are all a very important part of Shiloh, but the Battle of Shiloh was only a brief instant in a much longer struggle which nature is still carrying out in the area.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forces of nature were hard at work shaping Shiloh and the surrounding lands long before man first viewed the scene. Centuries of shifting, carving, and eroding passed before the land began to take its present-day form. Years more passed before man visited the area.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first men probably came as hunters in search of food. They left little evidence of their passing, but they remembered the high bluffs that always remained safe from the frequent flooding which swept the surrounding lowlands. Eventually these people returned to build homes and ceremonial lodges. Thus, man became a small but important part of the scene.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian lefts as mysteriously as he had come, but the door had been opened. Explorers and adventurers from across the seas soon followed. Eventually, the farmer and settler came to tame the land. Man could no longer be classed as a casual visitor or temporary resident.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time of the Civil War, the woods of Shiloh had been opened, and in many places there were small cornfields and cotton patches pushing up through the recently cleared soil. Small cabins began to dot the landscape as "Man, the Master of the Land" built his farms.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=70><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land was farmed, and sometimes abandoned, for years following the Civil War, but Shiloh had become something special. Men had struggled and died on its fields to defend their personal beliefs. As a result, Shiloh became a National Military Park, a monument to man and his ideals.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=53><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Shiloh became a park it also became a living example of how man and nature must work together. Man was sometimes unwise in his use of land, but perhaps the&nbsp; errors of the past can help us today to better conserve the land.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=70><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservation, above all, should mean wise use. To use our land wisely we must first understand what goes on there and how man’s actions can influence nature. We are capable of altering the land in ways that would require centuries to repair. However, we must remember that man is still a newcomer. Eventually, nature is always the winner.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of this hike will depend entirely upon you. All of the stops will not require a written answer, and there can be no one answer that is most correct for certain other points. These stops are no less important than those that do require specific answers. In fact one stop may give key information that is needed later on. You will be on your honor as you travel this trail. If you just answer the questions, the day will have very little meaning. But if you take the time to look, to listen and to understand what is around you, the day can open a fascinating new world of which you were hardly aware.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you walk, think of nature as a series of related activities. Everything, including man, is dependent on its environment. Two terms will be very helpful in understanding these relationships.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first term is ECOLOGY. Ecology refers to the study of the interrelationships, which must exist between any form of life and its surroundings. This applies to all life from the smallest to the largest, plants and animals. Factors of the surroundings include everything from the soil and water underfoot to the air and sun overhead.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second term is WEB OF LIFE. The Web of Life is a diagrammatic way of showing that all forms of life, including man, are interrelated in some way. The strands of sun, air, water and soil support the web, just as certain key strands hold a spider web in proper position so that the spider may function and survive. Damage to any part of the web causes vibrations to pass throughout it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun is a major requirement of most producers (plants) in the Web of Life. Plants gather light energy through their leaves; and by using a process called photosynthesis; they convert the energy into sugar. The difference in the two drawing should indicate the need for sunlight. The tree in the open can absorb sunlight easily from all sides so it becomes full and spreading. The forest trees can only get enough light from above, so they are forced to grow up to the light or die out in favor of hardier or faster growing trees.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have considered the effects of the sun on just one small part of the Web of Life so far, but it must be remembered that no portion of the Web can stand by itself. The necessity for light energy is most easily recognized in our plant life, but it is just as necessary for the other forms of life, which compose the consumers and decomposers.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of our world and our environment as a large, natural machine made up of many gears, which turn against each other. If a single tooth on any of the gears should break, the whole machine is thrown out of balance. The broken gear could be a tree or shrub, a fox, a group of microscopic bacteria – or it might even be man himself.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you ever stop to think of all the soil does?&nbsp; It anchors plants, supplies minerals and food, holds moisture and contains valuable forms of plant and animal life to name just a few things.&nbsp; All the plant food we eat grows in a thin, upper layer of the soil.&nbsp; Our lives and the lives of other living things around us all depend on that fragile layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soil is really not suitable for growing things unless it is a mixture of both rock fragments (dirt) and organic matter (such as the decaying leaves).&nbsp; This combination of basic materials takes place in many ways.&nbsp; The weather and the actual materials involved are the deciding factors in what type of soil is formed.&nbsp; There are many different soil types, each of which is given a specific name.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=104><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This soil is called Savannah Silt Loam.&nbsp; The thick leaf layer you just examined plays a major role in nourishing this soil type and holding moisture.&nbsp; This natural litter is a key factor in distinguishing the soil at this location from the soil of old fields where the soil building process has been broken.&nbsp; Look closely at the decaying leaves and you may see streaks of white mold running through them.&nbsp; These mold streaks belong to the decomposer strand on the Web of Life, and they play an important role in breaking down the leaves and returning nutrients to the soil.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "dirt" under the leaves is a loam, which simply means that mineral earth has combined with organic matter to form a basic soil mixture.&nbsp; The entire Savannah Silt Loam is made up of several layers beginning with the leaf litter on top and going all the way down to coarse gravel and clay on the bottom.&nbsp; This complete layering pattern is called a <U>soil profile.</U>&nbsp; Different soil profiles result in different soil types.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=53><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light, soil, water and air form the basic framework of the Web of Life.&nbsp; The lack of any one of these may very well mean that the producers, consumers and decomposers (which include all living things) may not be able to survive.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air is probably the most difficult of the four basic items to understand since we can't see pure air, but it is only necessary to hold your breath a while to remember how important air really is. The smoke and fumes which now hang over many of our cities gives us another reminder of how important our air is and how easily we can damage it.&nbsp; All living things "breathe" in one way or another, but most life will suffer and possibly even vanish if the air that surrounds it becomes to badly abused.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=104><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing may be the most obvious use of air, but there are many other uses that we may overlook.&nbsp; What about the weather?&nbsp; Are there any clouds overhead?&nbsp; Where does rain come from?&nbsp; It is air circulation that creates wind and brings us our changing weather patterns.&nbsp; Other places where we don't give much thought to air include the soil under our feet and the various lakes, rivers and oceans.&nbsp; Unless the oxygen content in soil and water is at the proper level, most life will not survive there.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=70><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of soil oxygen can be a serious problem in our parks.&nbsp; Thousands of people walking or driving over the same ground can cause the soil to pack so solidly that air is blocked from the roots of nearby plants.&nbsp; The very features that people come to see can be destroyed in these cases unless travel is carefully restricted to roads or trails.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=70><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All too often we take air for granted and think there is nothing that we can do about it, but there are visible signs almost everywhere we go that the air can be damaged. Today even the distant reaches of the Arctic and Antarctic bear traces of airborne pollution.&nbsp; Man must be aware of all his surroundings and he must make every effort to use all resources wisely.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two counts should show a large variation in number, although there is no exact number that each person should get.&nbsp; If you are careful in your count, the number from 4B should be larger than the one from 4A.&nbsp; There are several reasons why this is so.&nbsp; They all relate to the fact that the various plants are competing with each other for space and for the basic elements necessary to support the Web of Life.&nbsp; There are probably two factors that are particularly responsible for this.&nbsp; One of these would be sunlight.&nbsp; The other would be water.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=121><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about the two spots where you made the sample vegetation counts.&nbsp; The sun reaches both areas in similar amounts, but how much actually reaches the ground in each case?&nbsp; When the forest is old (at 4A), much of the light energy is absorbed by the forest canopy before it ever reaches the smaller plants near the ground.&nbsp; The young trees at 4B have not formed enough of a canopy to shut off light from the ground level, but as they grow they will also block more and more sunlight until only those small plants that can live in reduced light will survive.&nbsp; When that time comes, the vegetation counts will be about the same in the two locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=104><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar struggle goes on beneath the forest floor as the trees and smaller plants compete for water and soil nutrients.&nbsp; Trees such as the large oaks at 4A have roots that cover as much or more area below ground as their branches cover above ground.&nbsp; These roots can draw so much moisture that there is often very little left for the shallow rooted plants during dry spells.&nbsp; Since the trees are smaller at 4B, the competition is not so one-sided and the shallow-rooted shrubs and grasses can still compete.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;Think about the results of&nbsp; the two counts again.&nbsp; A forest might be compared to your house.&nbsp; You can't understand its full history unless you know what has taken place all the way from its basement to the roof over&nbsp; the attic.&nbsp; A canopy of branches and leaves form the forest&nbsp; roof and the soil underneath forms the basement.&nbsp; Just as it is with a house, there may be several floor levels in between.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

5)&nbsp; Nature is an ever-changing thing.&nbsp; Forested areas are constantly being destroyed by man and sometimes by nature.&nbsp; However, no matter how the land becomes barren, the pattern followed in returning to a mature forest is about the same.&nbsp; The process of developing from bare ground to a mature plant community is called <U>natural succession</U>.&nbsp; In the Shiloh area, bare ground is soon covered by a blanket of small, mixed plants that are replaced by rapidly growing shrubs such as blackberry and sumac.&nbsp; Small trees and saplings follow the shrubs.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;Competition is the key to the stages of succession.&nbsp; In each stage of development, a few types will lose out in the harsh struggle for survival.&nbsp; Eventually, if nature is given time, the competition will lead to a mature forest of the type that existed before the land was disturbed.&nbsp; This complete process of succession may take several hundred years; but regardless of the time involved; it will follow a certain pattern.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;Most of the small trees you now see are sweetgum.&nbsp; They probably started from the seeds of two large trees growing nearby on the north edge of Peabody Road.&nbsp; Sweetgum is typical of trees that come in on recently cleared areas.&nbsp; The seeds are light and easily scattered.&nbsp; Trees of this type are called <U>pioneer species</U>, since they are pioneering on barren ground.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=138><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
Like most pioneer species, sweetgum is very <U>intolerant</U>.&nbsp; This means that they can't tolerate shade and that they need open, sunny conditions to survive.&nbsp; Most pioneer species would die if they were forced to compete with larger, more tolerant trees.&nbsp; However, they play an important part in nature by paving the way for more tolerant trees which may need a certain amount of shade to get their start. As these small sweetgums get larger, they will choke out most of the undergrowth that now exists.&nbsp; Eventually, when these trees weaken from old age and disease, the oaks will take over due to their greater tolerance or ability to survive under the remaining canopy of old trees.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay close attention as you visit other fields in the park, and you will see that sweet gum is usually one of the first trees to come in as natural succession progresses.&nbsp; Sweet gum produces very fine wood, and is highly valued in many places as a lumber producer.&nbsp; Its star-shaped leaves and round, spiked seed capsules make identification easy when they are present.&nbsp; Take a close look at several twigs on these young trees for another good identification point.&nbsp; You should see a corky ridge developing on some of them.&nbsp; These ridges become more obvious on older trees.&nbsp; <B><U>DEFINE NATURAL SUCCESSION IN YOUR OWN WORDS.</U></b><!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloody Pond is a name that is well known to all who have heard the story of Shiloh.&nbsp; The soldiers who crawled to it during the heat of battle left its waters stained with blood.&nbsp; However, not all of Bloody Pond's past has been so colorful.&nbsp; A 1908 report by the Shiloh Military Park Commission read, "Bloody Pond has been fenced, to keep out hogs and cattle that were making it a nuisance."<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike most small ponds of its size, Bloody Pond never goes dry.&nbsp; Rainwater helps to keep it filled and swells its size at times, but a natural seep is responsible for its continuous survival.&nbsp; Most ponds fed by an underground flow also have and outlet.&nbsp; Apparently the Flow into Bloody Pond is just enough to equal the water lost through evaporation.&nbsp; Otherwise, the pond would continue to rise until it overflowed.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloody Pond might be no more than a marshy spot or perhaps even solid ground by now if it wasn't for the controlling actions of man.&nbsp; Each summer the banks of the pond become lined with thick clumps of water plants.&nbsp; If park officials didn't remove these plants,&nbsp; they would continually fill in the shallow edges.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each fall the plants that grew during the summer would die and begin to decay.&nbsp; The next spring a new group of water plants would start growing just a tiny bit nearer the center of the pond.&nbsp; This endless cycle of growth and decay would eventually create a rich, spongy layer around the edge.&nbsp; Since Bloody Pond is so shallow, the spongy layer would continue to spread until it finally covered the entire pond with a solid mat of decayed water plants.&nbsp; This is the basic process used in forming large beds of peat moss in certain parts of the world.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular fire wasn't severe enough to destroy the larger oaks.&nbsp; However, the damage to the smaller trees and saplings is still easily seen by looking at the broken tangle that remains.&nbsp; The thicker bark and higher branches of the older trees provided some protection from the fire that was not available to the younger trees. If a fire is not too intense, the older trees frequently survive, but even these trees are often weakened in such a way that insects and disease can get a foothold.&nbsp; The tangled mass left by a forest fire often provides an ideal breeding place for three-destroying insects.&nbsp; Foresters must be on the alert for dangerous insect buildups under such conditions.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

The interdependence of living things as described in ecology should be pretty well established in your mind by now.&nbsp; You have seen how the world operates with interactions of everything from man down to the smallest forms of plants and animals.&nbsp; In doing this, you have probably looked at one of the best examples of these interactions hundreds of times without realizing it.</font><!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you walk, look about you at the trunks of the oak trees.&nbsp; You have seen hundreds of them already, but have you really examined them?&nbsp; Take a closed look now.&nbsp; In most cases you will see large patches of a mottled, grayish scale on the bark.&nbsp; This gray substance is lichen (pronounced "like-en").&nbsp; It is not a part of the tree, but it is a very important and unusual member of natures' family.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=53><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lichen is unique since it actually is made up of two living things that are completely dependent on each other for survival.&nbsp; Special types of fungus and algae make up the two partners found in lichen.&nbsp; Together they can survive where neither could manage alone.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The algae performs its role in the partnership by producing food through the process of photosynthesis.&nbsp; The fungus returns the favor by providing protection for the algae and furnishing water and minerals.&nbsp; By combining their abilities, they both have all they need for survival.&nbsp; This process of two things working together so that both will benefit is called symbiosis.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of its drab appearance, lichen is an extremely important member of the natural community.&nbsp; This is due in large part to its ability to grow under the most difficult conditions.&nbsp; Lichen can establish itself on bare rock where nothing else could grow, and as it grows it gradually loosens small fragments of the rock.&nbsp; The building up of these fragments is one of the most basic of all soil producing techniques.&nbsp; Eventually, as the rock flakes accumulate, other plants can get a foothold.&nbsp; In this manner the soil continually builds until complex plant and animal communities can grow on what used to be nothing but bare rock.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth's crust is so full of variations that it is hard to imagine most of them.&nbsp; One of these variations that it is responsible for Rhea Spring that bubbles out of the hillside near this spot.&nbsp; Occasionally a water-absorbent layer of earth occurs directly over a water-resistant layer.&nbsp; As water percolates down through the upper layers it reaches the resistant under layer and flows along it to provide a highly valued underground water supply.&nbsp; A break in&nbsp; these layers allows the water to escape in much the same way a man-made canal allows the water to flow from a river or stream.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=87><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually these underground breaks or springs occur at some point where a hill cuts through the layers of earth.&nbsp; The hillside creates a break in the underground water flow, and the water escapes along the water-resistant shelf much like water might flow from a saturated sponge resting on an inclined board.&nbsp; Rhea Spring is only&nbsp; one of several small springs at Shiloh, which supply the creeks of the area with water during the dryer months.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cluster of springs in this location probably explains why Shiloh Church and various other buildings were built near here.&nbsp; Although the water of these springs was once used for all purposes, including drinking, it is no longer considered safe for drinking without further treatment and testing.&nbsp; Impurities have filtered down through years of land use to change what was once considered an excellent supply of safe drinking water.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A twig tossed into the creek near the footbridge will often bring a swirl of activity from the minnows that swim there.&nbsp; They are just one part of the living community that depends on water for survival.&nbsp; If you are lucky, you may even see a snapping turtle lying motionless below the bridge in hopes that a fish will venture a little too close to his powerful jaws.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT=104><!--mstheme--><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fish and the turtles, along with all the creatures that haunt the stream banks, are dependent on the continued flow of the springs for their way of life.&nbsp; As long as the rainwater is absorbed into the earth, the springs should flow.&nbsp; This vital absorption depends on vegetative ground cover to hold the water in place long enough for it to soak in.&nbsp; Hopefully, Shiloh will never be faced with the loss of this valuable ground cover, but it is already a serious problem in other parts of the country.<!--mstheme--></font></TD>
