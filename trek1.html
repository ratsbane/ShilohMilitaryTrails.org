          <H2>Shiloh Battlefield Trek</H2>

          <P>This is a two mile long educational
          hike through some of the most interesting area of Shiloh National
          Military Park.&nbsp; This short, easy, and informative hike is designed especially
          for Cub Scouts, Junior Girl Scouts, and other young hikers not old enough
          to be eligible for the much longer Shiloh Military Trails (which is 14
          miles longer and is for hikers at least 11 years old).&nbsp; The Shiloh
          Battlefield Trek is designed to introduce young hikers, their parents,
          and group leaders to the historic battlefield of Shiloh and show them
          where some of the most fierce fighting occurred.&nbsp; Included on the
          route are such famous Shiloh landmarks as the Hornets Nest, Sunken road,
          War Cabin, Peach Orchard and Ruggles' Batteries.

         <P>A leader of a group desiring to hike the Shiloh Battlefield
         Trek should write to the Shiloh Military Trail Committee several weeks
         in advance of the proposed hiking date and request a map for his
         group.&nbsp; The hiking information and credential cards can be printed
         from the web site.&nbsp; Please order enough maps so each leader may
         have one.&nbsp; You will need to print the credential card and copy this
         so that each hiking participant has one to complete.

         <P>Use Part A of Unit Application to hike Shiloh Battlefield
         Trek to order maps and other printed materials.

         <H3>Suggested Schedule</H3>

         <P>A.&nbsp; First, go to the Park Visitor Center.&nbsp; See
         the movie (shown daily every 45 minutes).&nbsp; Visit the Museum and
         look up some answers to questions asked (record answers on your
         credential card).


         <P>B.&nbsp; Start the self guided auto battlefield tour -
         use park brochure for map.&nbsp; When you reach Hornets Nest Road (just
         past U.D.C. Confederate Monument ) turn left and proceed to the center
         of the Hornets Nest and park your car there.


         <P>C.&nbsp; No take the Shiloh Battlefield Trek.&nbsp; This
         is a figure eight shaped route and you will finish back where you began
         after hiking approximately 2 miles.


         <P>D.&nbsp; Then complete the balance of self guided auto
        tour of the battlefield.&nbsp; <i>This is not required, but your group
        may like to take other short hikes at other stopping points - as from -
        Shiloh Church to the Tennessee Monument - the Indian Mounds Trek - and
        possibly others.</i>

        <H3>Miscellaneous</H3>

        <P>A nice picnic area is available in Sowell Field - located
        on the west side of Highway #22&nbsp; about one miles south of the main
        entrance to the Park.

        <P>NO WATER is available along the auto tour or trek
        route&nbsp; (except at Visitor Center) so canteens may be desirable in
        hot weather.&nbsp; Two restaurants (The Back Porch and the Shiloh
        Battlefield Cafe) are located near the intersection of Tennessee Highway
        @22 and @142 neat the southwest corner of the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Souvenirs are available at Ed Shaw's Shop.
