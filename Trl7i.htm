      trails program, which has been in existence at Shiloh National Military
      Park since 1960 under the u\auspices of Shiloh Military Trail, Inc. The
      Environmental Trail is an interesting and educational hike, which may be
      made by anyone at all seasons of the year. It is especially recommended
      for Boy and Girl Scouts and other youth groups (school, church, YMCA, etc.),
      as well as for all who are interested in nature, the out-of doors, and the
      wise use of our resources and quality of our environment. NOTE – Due to
      the educational reading material associated with this hike, all hikers who
      wish to qualify for the special patch award must be at least 11 years old.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

      approximately twelve miles long. It is a loop trail beginning and ending
      near the southwest cornier of the park (by Ed Shaw’s Restaurant). As an
      alternate, groups camping at Shiloh can begin and end this hike from the
      camping area (see Map). Allow 6 to 7 hours minimum to complete this hike.
      Each hiker should carry a pencil and canteen. It is recommended that each
      hiking group also carry a compass, snakebite kit, first aid kit, and
      possibly a tree identification book.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
