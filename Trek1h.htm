        served the needs of the few families that lived along its two mile length.&nbsp;
        Dust rose from ever-deepening ruts in dry weather to sting the eyes and
        throats of these who used it.&nbsp; And frequent rains turned the dust
        into mud, causing iron rimmed wheels to sink axle-deep as work horses
        strained against their harnesses.&nbsp; Both the North and the South
        used roads similar to this one to move long lines of men and supplies
        from one point to another, but this road was to serve another
        need.&nbsp; Its deep ruts offered a small amount of protection to hard
        pressed Union soldiers who fell back before a deadly line of Confederate
        guns.&nbsp; This was a place to stop and make a stand while there was
        still a chance.&nbsp; Union soldiers were shoulder to shoulder along the
        length of&nbsp; Sunken Road.&nbsp; Here they waited for the wild Rebel
        charges that they knew would come.&nbsp; In the hours that followed,
        some of the most severe fighting of the Civil War took place along this
        once peaceful farm road.&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></td>

        The woods may seem thick today both they were even thicker in
        1862.&nbsp; Swift striking cavalrymen watched impatiently as the battle
        developed both their horses were nearly useless in the thick woods and
        dense underbrush. Shiloh was to be a battle of infantrymen - a face to
        face fight between foot soldiers.&nbsp; Soldiers dropped under the
        steady hail of bullets that ripped through these woods.&nbsp; For six
        long, costly hours the Union forces held along the line of Sunken
        Road.&nbsp; some weakened under the deadly Rebel attack and fled to the rear,
        but for the rest there was little time for thoughts of running.&nbsp;
        Load, fire, reload and fire again - these were the only thoughts that
        remained.&nbsp; At best, most men could only load and fire their heavy
        muskets three times in one minute, but that was enough to leave hundreds
        of dead and wounded scattered across Shiloh's tangled grounds.&nbsp;
        Perhaps the losses of the 31st.&nbsp; Indiana Infantry at this spot will
        help you to better understand what it was like for the men who once
        faced each other through these woods.&nbsp;<br>

        Modern military commanders are seldom farther from help than the nearest
        two-way radio.&nbsp; But Civil War leaders had to depend on the speed
        and skill of a trusted messenger to send for reinforcements.&nbsp;
        Answers often took hours and even days in coming.&nbsp; Others were
        erased forever by s sniper's bullet.&nbsp; Poor communications were one
        reason why Civil War battles were so often fought by long lines of
        yelling soldiers who charged time and again directly into a deadly wall
        of enemy shot and shell.&nbsp; Radios were unheard of but the flash of a
        saber and the sight of a battleflag was all the signal needed by the men
        who stood in those hard fighting lines.&nbsp; The battleflag played an
        important role in the fighting at Shiloh.&nbsp; It gave the soldiers a
        point to line up on and most men would follow it as long as it could be
        seen through the smoke of the battle.&nbsp; Great pride was placed in a battleflag
        and many men lost their lives trying to protect their unit flag or
        trying to keep it moving forward.&nbsp; If a flag bearer was hit another
        man would immediately sweep the flag from the ground and move on with
        it.&nbsp; Anyone who carried the flag into battle became a target for
        every enemy gun but many a soldier ignored this threat as he carried his
        flag into a hail of enemy bullets.&nbsp;<br>

        across the field stands empty and quiet now, but it wasn't always that
        way.&nbsp; Imagine an early morning here a few weeks before the Battle
        of Shiloh.&nbsp; A rooster would have welcomed the new day from a nearby
        tree.&nbsp; And perhaps a droopy eared hound would have moved from his
        bed on the front porch&nbsp; to sniff the fresh morning air.&nbsp; Soon smoke
        would curl from the chimney and the aroma of frying bacon would drift
        across the freshly plowed fields.&nbsp; Next would come the laughter of
        children as they arose from their beds in the cabin loft.&nbsp; Soon
        breakfast would be over and there would be work to be done.&nbsp; Spring
        was on its way and the fields had to be planted or there would be no
        cotton or wheat or corn when the winter winds came once again.&nbsp; A
        few weeks later those fields were pounded under the feet of hundreds of soldiers
        and torn by the wheels of cannons.&nbsp; The nearby peach orchard had
        been prized by those who lived here but the blossoms were cut by bullets
        that spring to fall softly on the bodies of dead and dying
        soldiers.&nbsp; Even the cabin fell - destroyed by fire and exploding
        cannon balls. The family had escaped but their home was gone.&nbsp;
        Still, the land was there and it would grow more crops.&nbsp; The land
        was the most important.&nbsp; The cabin could be rebuilt.&nbsp; The
        bullet scarred logs of another cabin were moved here to build the house
        you see today.&nbsp; bitter memories remained but life had to go
        on.&nbsp; Look closely at the cabin to see how it was built.&nbsp;
        Notice how wood pegs were used in place of nails.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b><br>

        may have been Indians who watched silently from the forest edge in hopes
        a deer would come to drink.&nbsp; Much later, settlers depended on the
        pond for water to fill their daily needs and water their
        livestock.&nbsp; the names of those who know and depended on these
        spring-fed waters have mostly been forgotten.&nbsp; But the pond itself
        will be remembered for years to come because of the fighting and
        suffering which once surrounded it.&nbsp; Wounded soldiers made their
        way here to drink and bathe their wounds.&nbsp; Some were strengthened
        but many fell face down, never to rise again.&nbsp; The blood of Yankee
        and Rebel alike slowly blended to turn the water a deep read.&nbsp; From
        that day on the name of Bloody Pond would be a part of American
        history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        Others returned but were never the same.&nbsp; Still, there were some
        who never lost their dreams in spit of the hardships of war.&nbsp; One
        such man was the captain who commanded the cannon which fired from this
        spot.&nbsp; He lost an arm at Shiloh but he still went on to become a
        famous western explorer and a nationally know scientist.&nbsp; This man
        led the first expedition ever to follow the Colorado River through the
        rugged and dangerous Grand Canyon.&nbsp; He did with one arm what most

        distance into the woods and stop.&nbsp; Thousand upon thousands of men
        wore the blue and gray uniforms of the Civil War.&nbsp; It was a hard
        life.&nbsp; Long hours of guard duty and dull camp life were often
        followed by mile after mile of marching through ankle - deep mud or
        clouds of choking dust.&nbsp; Days and even weeks sometimes passed
        without any real fighting but the threat of battle was always
        there.&nbsp; Soldiers on the move often lived in the open with little or
        no shelter. A man's gear often dropped to just his musket, the clothes
        he wore and whatever he could carry in his pockets.&nbsp; A tent and a
        dry bed became something to dream about during the long hours of a rainy
        night.&nbsp; Uniforms quickly became worn and dirty and shoes wore paper
        thin.&nbsp; The biting of lice and fleas added to the discomfort and
        sickness was always a danger in the crowded camps.&nbsp; d0ctors were
        scarce and a battle wound could mean the loss of a leg or an arm - or
        worse.&nbsp; Food was often scarce.&nbsp; Each man usually gat a small
        supply of coffee, flour and bacon and the cooking was left up to
        him.&nbsp; At times he was hungry.&nbsp; Remember the cabin you visited
        and the small mall field you just crossed?&nbsp; The people who lived
        there would have owned chickens, pigs and maybe even a cow or two.&nbsp;
        It was hard on the farmer, but the small farms sometimes offered the
        only food available to a fast moving army.&nbsp; Look at the forest
        around you.&nbsp; You may see only trees, bushes and small plants.&nbsp;
        But to a country born soldier of the Civil Was those same trees, bushes
        and plants meant as much as a trip to the grocery store or drugstore
        today.&nbsp; Many nuts, berries, roots and leaves could be eaten .&nbsp;
        Others could be crushed into a powder an d used to treat everything from
        sore feet to malaria.&nbsp; There were even twigs that could be peeled
        and robbed against the teeth to remove tobacco stains.&nbsp; A wood-wise
        soldier could find dozens of this to make life a little easier.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></td>

        but caused only a small part of the casualties at Shiloh.&nbsp; The
        artilleryman didn't make the shoulder to shoulder charges that the
        infantryman made but his duties were every bit as dangerous.&nbsp; It
        was not unusual for the enemy to make a mass charge directly toward a
        cannon.&nbsp; this was as dangerous for the charging infantry as it was
        for the artillerymen.&nbsp; An artillery crew sometimes fought hand to
        hand rather than five up their gun.&nbsp; Hard, backbreaking work filled
        the life of an artilleryman.&nbsp; A single mistake by any crew member
        could have cost his life or that of a fellow soldier.&nbsp; The only way
        to load and fire safely was to put in endless hours of practice and
        drill no matter where they were or what the weather was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        different the scene would be if you added over 400 artillerymen, over
        300 horses and about three times as many cannons as you now see.&nbsp;
        Add to this the several hundred infantrymen who had been charging across
        the field&nbsp; and you can get some idea of the confusion that must
        have existed here.&nbsp; A full Civil War gun crew had as many as eight
        men to handle all the steps of loading and firing.&nbsp; They used up to
        six horses to move a cannon and its ammunition cart which was called a
        caisson.&nbsp; When coupled to its limber the caisson became a four wheeled
        vehicle.&nbsp; tools and items necessary for firing the cannon were carried
        on the limber.&nbsp; There were several kinds of cannon in the same unit
        and this meant that there had to be several kinds of ammunition to fit
        them.&nbsp; Look carefully at the two guns in front of you and you will
        see that they are not the same.&nbsp; The problems of moving a large number
        of men, horsed and cannons were many.&nbsp; General Ruggles knew this
        when he ordered Southern guns to form along this line, but there was no
        other choice.&nbsp; A mistake could have meant the loss of hundreds of men
        but no decision at all could have been even worse.&nbsp; Continue along
        Ruggles line until you come to the plaque for Bankkead's Tennessee
        Battery.&nbsp;<br>

        fighting has been hard all morning and some of your friends were hit,
        but you were lucky.&nbsp; You are tired and scared and your shoulder hurts
        from firing your musket but you will go on.&nbsp; The word coming down
        the line is that the Yankees have stopped running and are waiting at the
        edge of those woods.&nbsp; This time there won't be any surprise.&nbsp;
        They will be ready and the attack will be costly.&nbsp; In fact there
        may be a gun aimed your way right now.&nbsp; Look at the men who stand
        beside you.&nbsp; Will they still be there after the charge or will even
        your own luck run out before you can cross that field?&nbsp; The command
        to move up on line cuts short any further thoughts you might have
        had.&nbsp; Quickly you check your musket to be sure it is ready and then
        you glance&nbsp; to your right to line up on a battleflag tattered from
        earlier charges.&nbsp; You look to the left in time to see your
        commander ride to the front and slowly look up and down the long line of
        soldiers.&nbsp; The time has come!&nbsp; The commander's saber flashes
        in the sun and the cry to charge echoes down the line.&nbsp; There is no
        longer any time for thoughts of fear.&nbsp; You are running now and
        shouting at the top of your lungs.&nbsp; The enemy must be driven
        back.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></td>
